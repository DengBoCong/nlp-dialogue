1	hey i was wondering if it is possible to make caps lock a regular key ( stay functional as a key but not trigger the capitol lock )	it can be done easily with xmodmap ( or your ~/ xmodmap file )	but that would just be remapping it to a different key right	i put altgr there and can show you my config as an example	of course i also disable the lock function	ideally it would be a key that does nothing but allows shortcuts to be bound to it	you should map it to super or meta or whatever then	the thing is that i need a short cut on it that i need to hold down from time to time whilst doing other thing like typing etc holding down the super key does n't allow me to type anymore is there a way to make a key without a function somehow	i figured it out thanks a bunch :)	you re welcome remove lock = caps_lock disables the caps lock feature but leaves the button usable for shortcuts and so on :)

1	guys how do i uninstall nero linux ?? i installed it by just unpacking tar to __path__	first of all why on earth would you unpack it to __path__ ??	because thats what it said in the nfo	there are folders in tar and it copies properly	i understand that it will copy properly but the __path__ directory is definitely not a good place for you to manually install software to it should go in your home folder to keep things safe	but since all you really did was extract an archive you can uninstall nero by simply deleting that directory	its not only one dir but ok i ll open tar file and locate all files from it	just delete the top-level directory for it	and i thing that nero has to be installed with root permissions that will delete all files/directories within it
