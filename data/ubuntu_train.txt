1	basically it looks like your file-system has become corrupted then thankfully however your __path__ directory has remained in-tact you can run some disk checks on your hard disk to see if you can recover errors if you wish or reinstall ubuntu keeping most of your settings and all of your __path__ folder files in tact	so how can i retain my files and get everything alright	fsck -pf __path__ try that first though	actually sudo fsck -pv __path__	sorry i mean sudo fsck -pf __path__	hmm this means that ubuntu will need a reinstall from the livecd can you go through the steps of the install until the stage where you choose where you want to install ubuntu and then message me again since then we can preserve your user settings and files	because the partition __path__ is intact and that is where you have kept your files the file system at __path__ is your ubuntu partition where the operating system is installed to ubuntu checks __path__ on your system to find your files and settings	i ll explain what to do when you get to the stage in the installer where you have to choose where ubuntu is installed i hope that i can better sense of it to you there	sda5 is where your home folder/directory is kept on the system that you setup so luckily that wo n't be erased	when it asks you where in the installer where you d like to install click on advanced setup and i ll talk you through the steps	the correct option should be titled specify partitions manually or something similar	okay good right click on sda5 what are the options called ( sorry i m not in the installer atm so i ca n't remember the exact names )	click change then next to mount point set it to __path__ and then make sure that the format the partition box is not ticked	then do change on sda6 make sure that it is ext4 that for the format box is ticked and that the mount point is __path__	sorry for sda6 the mount point is __path__ not __path__	well ext4 is a preference for me but you can use ext3 too	for sda5 change the mount point to __path__ and make sure the formatting box is not ticked for sda6 make sure the mount point is __path__ and that the formatting box is ticked	when you re happy click forward and finish the install	try to make sure that you use the same username as last time and preferrably same password so it keeps your user settings	same password is n't required but it helps with wireless keyrings enjoy

1	ok im back	any ideas on how to trouble shoot this	ok did you download all the stuff from the readme and install it	alnost	i think you also need to install libhid0	synaptic does n't find libswig .. is that important	maybe i do n't know	if stuff does n't work you will have to compile it yourself and install it	you there	yes still trying to figure this out still no ideas	well after reading the documentation it should of worked without all these extra stuff with hiddev somehow your device is not being recognized	um are you using the 1208ls	the 1208fs it works in windows with the manufacturers software i just tried it	could it be that the test program is looking in the wrong place maybe ubuntu puts the usb devices somewhere else ?? ( i m only testing it with the test-usb1208fs program )	are you still there	well i am totally at a loss and i do n't know if i can do anything more without actually having your device as with most things with linux either it works or it does n't and if it does n't it could but can be very hard to get to work i think your device might actually be blacklisted in the hid-core stuff but i ca n't find it	do you think this is an issue __number__ need to be root or have the program run suid unless one configures with __path__ file with hotplug ."	when you plug in the device it should be recognized correctly and not as an xpad so if dmesg is not saying it is there it is n't there to use	but __path__ shows it __url__	its showing an xpad connecting if you rmmod the xpad you still wo n't have the correct driver loaded to use your device when you connect it should load the right driver

1	you never have to reboot with linux	once you ve blacklisted the module use rmmod to unload it	presumably then it s using the defaults there s a line you can add to the xorg conf to set the refresh rate ( forget what it is - try man xorg cong )	add it to __path__ d/blacklist - e.g. blacklist bcm43xx	horizsync & vertrefresh - there s caps somewhere	as you seem to be able to run grub get a grub prompt then find __path__ lst	->zorlac	you can set the grub params manually & you should be able to get the box back up	i m so glad :d	since when since they know to try root as an account name

1	hi all quick question about upgrading to feisty	i mean that seems a little high	is there some way to do the upgrade without consuming that much space in __path__	when i run update-manager -c -d the process errors out ( supposedly ) because of insufficient disk space on __path__ -- it requires __number__ mb but i ve sized it to only be ~22m ( this machine was previously a gentoo install where i had more control over what went in it )	you should be able to create some space by moving something within __path__ to another partition and leaving a symlink behind -- something like ln -s __path__ __path__	or remove __path__ from __path__ and point it to another location	well thing i m worried about is that the total size of __path__ is smaller than what this thing needs	and then ( say ) manually merge the real __path__ and the fake __path__ after update-manager is done hmm

1	i agree with santagada on java a distro which just works off the shelf needs java	but i think aside java and win32codecs there is n't much ubuntu does n't have ( aside mandrake s installer )	i m just pointing out objectively what a distro which just works needs irrespective of licensing	but althought java programmers are always saying java is free it is n't really	i am now remembering openbsd installation it asked for how many cillinders and other stupid information	yup and that s how partitioning for linux seems to most windows users who ve never partitioned before	i think what would be best would be a live cd that installs like noppix with parted and the internet to help a simple user	have you tried the mepis installer	never	they have exactly that mepis installs off the livecd there s a -f flag for apt-get too

1	hi i d like to know if there is any way to change the trash icon with a custom one without changing the whole iconset	not a specific one	anyone	i just want to change only the trash icon	what icon set are you using	navigate to your icon folder __path__ and change the icon there	just be sure to change it in all the folders there are several different folders for the different sizes of icon ( 32x32 48x48 scaleable )	just rename the old trash icon so it wont be deleted	if you ever need to change it back you still have the icon just fix the name to get the old one back to the extent of my knowledge the icon system does not use configuration files but rather just directly grabs the icon from their name and location in the folder

1	one would think so ... so why am i being told sorry you ca n't get updates you ll have to use a ppa "?	having updated packages i guess	i do n't know but i know that updates only carries fixes to serious bugs and backports only carries end-user packages which are unlikely to break anything else when installed and which are in the next ( development ) version	dopeghoti so if a package has been updated for karmic one could expect it to be backported to jaunty it s the nvidia drivers	no not necessaily a video driver is hardly an end-user package that s unlikely to break other stuff ( actually quite the contrary )	if anything that will end up in updates	but it s a system-critical package and the manufacturer has released a new version to fix critical bugs	i have just explained it but yes	ok wherever is there a page somewhere which explains the difference between backports and updates and whatever	so where do ppas fit in	it might be if you really want or need the updated driver now	ppa is just a personal tool for building one s own packages	whether you want to use someone else s ppa for some reason well that s entirely at your own risk	right i do n't :) but it was suggested to me that that s what i needed to do ....	that does n't make it a good idea but it might make it the only possible thing to do	you could in theory do two things __number__ ) report a bug about the driver __number__ ) request a backport in reality neither thing is going to work anyway	well i ve attempted to request a backport __path__ update __path__ whatever ... but a lot of the documentation on how to do that comes from a developer perspective not an end user perspective	that s because __number__ ) ubuntu developers have n't really any control on the driver since it s a closed-source driver and it s hard to ever check for regressions and __number__ ) this would n't really apply for backports ( and you ca n't directly request an updates update )	not always but in the case of the nvidia drivers yes pretty much	so you re saying that once a package is out there it s out there for good ???? how come multiple versions of the nvidia drivers exist then by the way other people may suggest using envyng rather than using ppa packages

1	thanks powertool	how do i remove a user in terminal	thanks tina	can i force a logout	you can open a terminal use su user to logoff to become the user then logout	passwd user	try ps aux | grep mythtv kill any running processes and try again does mythtv have a service which needs to be stopped first	*any running processes under the mythtv user	if that does n't work try this sudo pkill -kill -u username	you could try lsof | grep mythtv and close anything the user has open	is mythbackend a package if so try removing it first try sudo apt-get remove myth tab and see if it lists anything if so remove these

1	anyone here tried using vmware and had problems with grub	i think the deb files should be bittorrentable ...	patches to apt are welcome	i mean many people keep deb files in their __path__ directory for ages so they d be ideal for torrenting	i d be happy to patch apt with this functionality - md5 is already set up so should n't be much to do	haha	probably would n't need to make many changes to apt itself it could fork already written torrenting programs ..	it s not as simple as yo uthink	the main issue would be ensuring the deb files are available on the network so the ubuntu people would need to torrent enable their update servers	not simple why not	there are no update servers there are only the archive servers	have a look at the apt codebase sometime	well apt would still need to connect to the archive server to get the md5s i suppose but from then on it can save bandwidth by getting the parts via p2p	i m pretty sure md5 is not useful for guaranteeing that anymore	md5 is unfoolable	no sorry	anyway even if md5 can be reversed etc then they d need to find a replacement to md5 whether downloading direct or via p2p	what is dns poisoning webserver hacking etc md5 ca n't be reversed

1	pls	how do i turn the screen blank/lock off on unity	i tried power settings	every 5-10 minutes the window blanks and locks	you may want to try ubuntu tweak more user friendly	then move to power management and find the lock and disable it	its supposed to be a power management feature but in case it doesnt work perhaps ubuntu tweak will be faster and more reliable how do you find that in unity

1	hey everyone i have a laptop with an intel core i3 processor and an integrated intel graphics card it uses the intel i915 driver for the graphics the laptop screen works fine but any external monitor i connect ( through dsub ) showa a wavey image	and it is not the screen i tried two different very new screens	somehow it seems all pixels move from left to right causing the screen to be only remotely readable at 800x600px even then it is horrible but the higher the resolution the worse it gets	so it is not a hardware problem	maybe the screen update rate both monitors have the same problem and i am using the right refresh rates ( at least according to the screen resolution tools and the screen specs )

1	hey guys whats the best way of sharing files between say my home computer and a mcdonald s wifi hotspot	would a samba connection work between windows & ubuntu	samba	if there is a local area network you may share files using samba	would that not be possible over an internet connection just intranet	if you want to share files over internet you can use ssh or ftp	so if theres a lan -> samba if not -> ssh or ftp	you want to share files with windows clients	well i want to share files between my netbook ( ubuntu ) and my laptop ( windows __number__ )	ubuntu one ;)	dropbox is the same as ubuntu one but not from ubuntu	it s a cloud account - 2gb for free	it automagically synchronizes files	yup but i do n't know if there s a windows client dropbox has a client for every major os	i use wicd not network manager so i have to use dropbox and i like it	so you can try dropbox it s pretty good	hmm .. the only drawback is that you can share one folder .. i think	does ... __path__ and c :\ count but you ca n't share for example ~/dropbox and ~/documents/pictures

1	so this is an unlikely question but if i have an ssh session open from a to b now i ca n't ssh into a ( it s behind nat ) but i have access to b can i somehow reverse that ssh session from a to b to get a shell and execute commands on a these are all under the same username and i have sudo access to both machines	you can forward ports over ssh	and then ssh over that forwarded port	i m familiar with that ... but how would i do that since i ca n't run commands on a the computer behind nat since i ca n't reach it the only connection i have to it is that the ssh session shows up in who on b	you might be able to get though the nat are both ssh servers on port __number__	yes	have you tried sshing into a right now	yes it gets no route to host because the nat device is set to port forward __number__ to a different machine ( which is powered down )	and i can only modify the nat configuration from within the nat network	i do n't think there is much you can do okay thanks

1	can anyone give me link how to add vhost on ubuntu	all what i have got i dont understand them	hi ppl	like adding host masks to eggdrop	to hide my real ip	apache has nothing to do with the type of vhosts that you are talking about	what you need are multiple public ips and each one needs to resolve to a different domain	technically vhosts all point to a real ip	thats what im looking im new on linux stuff so any help wil be nice	if you do not want an ip that your own computer uses being shown run the bot from someone else s shell account	but if you do whois on mirc it wount show it	that s why reverse dns needs to be set up for the ips and the bot needs to bind to one of those ips	its very unstable and i wanna keep my company stuff in there so dont wanto to run it somone other pc	if those ips are owned by your isp they might not let you set up reverse dns for them	some irc networks do have the ability to scramble or hide ips	you mean +h flag	usermode +h/+x depending on the ircd	some networks have other methods like changing the host using services	how i set this up on eggdrop if it connects you know anything about that it depends on the network

1	hi guys is there a way to connect two monitors to a single ubuntu machine and display one workspace on monitor1 and workspace2 on monitor2	yes but might depend on the graphic card you have	redbox thanks	redbox it also depends on the motherboard not all mobos will support __number__ graphic cards - at least to run at the same time thanks i think you are also right

1	hey guys my laptop finally finds the wireless but when i connect to it it asks me for the password and i put it in ( i know its the right one double checked ) but it tries to connect then asks me again for the pasword whast can be wrong ??	had similar behaviour with usb w-lan sticks sometimes they would not connect to the router waiting a little bit or restarting the wlan router did the trick for me then	i tried that its weird it finally sees my network and once i connect and put in password it loads forever and then asksm e password again finally it says wireless disconnected and im back where i started ....	well do n't really know what the problem was in my case sometimes they connected and sometimes it took several minutes i have a laptop with integrated w-lan now and that works like a charm	so could be chipset-related or whatever	its weird because if i enable __path__ using laptop toggle if its disabled my wireless shows up in programs like network managers and wifi radar but at the top built-in network manager ubuntu has it shows my wirlress driver as off .... if i turn it on it does the opposite no program can detect my driver/wirlress networks in my area but the built-in ubuntu one can see my wirlress ...	hm strange maybe the guys here can help if you give details about the chipset and so on	does it say in hardware-jockey that it is using resricted drivers for your wireless	how do i check what it says in hardware jockey	it s under system administration hardware drivers	oh yea that it shows broadcom sta wirlress driver as activated and in use	then it should work hm i know i followed everything on the ubuntu site for broadcom wirlress drivers but still not working sucks big time cant do aynthing

1	hey after upgrade when ubuntu checks the filesystem on startup it gives me erros about ext2 on __path__ but that partition is ext3 how can i fix this	pelo but how about the erros it says it cant find superblock	ext3 is just ext2 with journaling i believe fcshk can't tell the different	check the forum for the error msg	man fsck	there is an option to set in fsck that will do that manpage it so you know which option to use i dont wanna check it now with fsck but on the next boot .. so it seems something related to checkfs

1	can i not change permissions of something if it is on a seperate partition if i can .. what are the filesystemtypes that wont work w/ it	i forgot to say fat32 by default does n't support unix style permissions if you want this then use umsdos or whatever it s called which overlays unix-style permissions onto a fat filesystem	also notable is that symlinks are incapable of affecting permissions in any way	when trying to run a script or instal l things .. such as py or bin .. i ca n't do anythign if it resides in the symlink folder .. if i move it to desktop it works as expected	they merely point to a file or directory which may or may not actually exist apps will attempt to load the directory referred to by the symlink	you ll need to be clearer than i ca n't do anything	provide the specific error message(s )	for example .. i attempted to run a py script to change the location of controls ... right click and run as executable checkbox is nulled out in folders that are running on fat32 symlinked directory .. but when i moved it to my desktop .. it worked as i read in instructions	that is because as i said fat filesystems do not have unix permissions you can force all files on a fat32 partition to be executable by changing the mount-time options e.g. adding exec umask=000 to the options	or you can try mounting as umsdos which adds a virtual layer of unix permissions over a fat filesystem i m not sure if that works with fat32 or just fat12/16 is there a different partitiontype u d recommend to use betweein mutual directories for win and linux ntfs

1	hi guys i ve just upgraded a __number__ machine to __number__ and i need to add a ppa but the add-apt-repository command appears to be missing	as does locate/updatedb :\	when i say missing i mean it s not on the path at least	__path__ :/ usr/local/bin :/ usr/sbin :/ usr/bin :/ sbin :/ bin :/ usr/bin/x11 :/ usr/games does n't look to be anything out of the ordinary there

1	ok i will try that	after you add the entry try sudo mkdir -p __path__ point	i just ran the uuid command blkid just out of curiosity and it reports the type= vfat for sda6	$ sudo mount -p sda6	ok that directory is made	then sudo umount your partition	then sudo mount -a	do i umount sda6 __path__ or __path__ because it says all three are not mounted	you can try that one but when you run mount -a it will try to mount everything	looks like there s a problem with the formatting	__url__	i posted the problem there but it looks like there is an ntfs problem is there a better thing to use than cfdisk from the command line	did you format that whole drive as ntfs or just a section of it	it is a partition of the entire hard drive and yes i formatted the whole partition ntfs	use fdisk and grep again to list all ntfs partitions	__number__ sec	here is what happens with each instance __url__	any thoughts	that s okay but if there is not any data on the drive you want to keep i would suggest using gparted to delete the partition and then reformat to whatever you like	can i do that from the command line sudo apt-get install gparted

1	what must i do to speed up my performance ?? almost happen is when open firefox	what next what	all i can suggest is use less addons	all i can suggest is renaming youor ~/ mozilla folder and rerunning this will give you stock __path__ minimal settings	try sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade	how much ram do you have	ok should be ok there	make sure you are fully updated	no need just use terminal	sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo apt-get dist-upgrade	then you need the gpg key for the medibuntu servers	its free dude	websearch round	its always changing	the service pack mentality is similar to the distro upgrade	in between individual apps are updated on the repo which then update to your system	it wont as hardwrae will always change	no im a dude with dead time on his hands	its pointles stelling me im just a user like you	linux will never get finished as it is always looking to improve and the teams making the apps you use are always improving their stuff too as new developments in coding and other such stuff come out it is used and linux changes again there will never be a day when linux rests as long as it moves forward 512mb is my reccommendation

1	how hard is it to compile progs from source in ubuntu	say for instance i wanted a few things to be a bit gentoo-like - tvtime mplayer etc would i have problems compiling these apps in ubuntu	do that but make sure to put them in a package so you can remove them in a controlled fashion -- use checkinstall if you do n't want to learn how to make debian packages by hand	thats what im asking - i can use those sources i d/l to build deb packages	yep -- plenty of info on that on the internet download the source and when you re about to type make install just type checkinstall instead ( provided you ve installed that program ) -- you ll get a package that you can remove using synaptic	a deb package	yeah checkinstall can make slackware-ish tar gz rpm and deb	you can also check out the project called apt-build :)	apt-build sounds interesting yeah does n't it :) i ve never used it but i checked it out when i went from gentoo to the debian world ;)

1	can anybody tell me about amarok	i have a problem connectin with zen	it s a nice music player mainly for kde users rhythmbox or exaile are great for gnome users	do you see it	odd ... did ubuntu recognise it at all	e.g. when u plugged it in did an auto-play thing come up	in rhythmbox go to edit plugins and put a check mark in the box beside portable players - mtp	if that does n't work i searched creative in the packages and found gnomad2 that might be of interest	it works but how can i copy the songs in desktop	drag and drop from rhythmbox onto the directory you want or just browse in file manager ( it should show up in the places menu on the left )

1	a question about ethernet bridges follows in a moment	why ca n't i ping across my ethernet bridge when it does at least work to the extent that mac addresses are visible and dhcp works	mabye icmp isnt allowed over the bridge	jsut dhcp and mac	yes ust dhcp and mac what s that about icmp i do n't understand	yes when i ping from either side all the packets are lost but when i do arp -an the mac address that i pinged will show up	thats the point of a bridge to allow only mac addresses that are requested	so icmp is simply the protocol ping uses then i also tried http ( one of the boxes runs apache ) and that did n't work either	its like a containment to each network	i m not with you ... you have __number__ networks and __number__ bridge
